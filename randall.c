/* Generate N bytes of random output.  */

/* When generating output this program uses the x86-64 RDRAND
   instruction if available to generate random numbers, falling back
   on /dev/random and stdio otherwise.

   This program is not portable.  Compile it with gcc -mrdrnd for a
   x86-64 machine.
